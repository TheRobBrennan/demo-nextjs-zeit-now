```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Your Next.js application will be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Available scripts

The following scripts are included for convenience:

+ `dev` - Starts Next.js in development mode
+ `start` - Starts Next.js in production mode
+ `build` - Builds the current Next.js application
+ `export` - Exports Next.js as a static site if desired
